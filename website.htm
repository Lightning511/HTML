Family:	        Felidae

Population:	Bengal tiger


The Bengal tiger is a population of the Panthera tigris tigris subspecies.
It ranks among the biggest wild cats alive today.
It is considered to belong to the world's charismatic megafauna.

The tiger is estimated to have been present in the Indian subcontinent since the Late Pleistocene, for about 12,000 to 16,500 years.
Today, it is threatened by poaching, loss and fragmentation of habitat, and was estimated at comprising fewer than 2,500 wild individuals. by 2011.
None of the Tiger Conservation Landscapes within its range is considered large enough to support an effective population of more than 250 adult individuals.

<pre>
  Felis tigris was the scientific name used by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for the tiger.
  It was subordinated to the genus Panthera by Reginald Innes Pocock in 1929.
  Bengal is the traditional type locality of the species and the nominate subspecies Panthera tigris tigris.
  The validity of several tiger subspecies in continental Asia was questioned in 1999.
  Morphologically, tigers from different regions vary little, and gene flow between populations in those regions is considered to have been possible during the Pleistocene.
  Therefore, it was proposed to recognise only two subspecies as valid, namely P. t. tigris in mainland Asia, and P. t. sondaica in the Greater Sunda Islands and possibly in Sundaland.
  The nominate subspecies P. t. tigris constitutes two clades: the northern clade comprises the Siberian and Caspian tiger populations, and the southern clade all remaining continental tiger populations.

  The extinct and living tiger populations in continental Asia have been subsumed to P. t. tigris since the revision of felid taxonomy in 2017.
  Results of a genetic analysis of 32 tiger samples indicate that the Bengal tiger samples grouped into a different clade than the Siberian tiger samples.[16]

<h2 id="Characteristics">Characteristics</h1>
<pre>
  The Bengal tiger's coat is yellow to light orange, with stripes ranging from dark brown to black;
  the belly and the interior parts of the limbs are white, and the tail is orange with black rings.
  The white tiger is a recessive mutant, which is reported in the wild from time to time in Assam, Bengal, Bihar, and especially in the former State of Rewa.
  However, it is not an occurrence of albinism. In fact, there is only one fully authenticated case of a true albino tiger, and none of black tigers, with the possible exception of one dead specimen examined in Chittagong in 1846.
  Fourteen Bengal tiger skins in the collection of the Natural History Museum, London have 21â€“29 stripes.

  The greatest skull length of a tiger is 351 mm (13.8 in) in males and 293 mm (11.5 in) in females.
  It has exceptionally stout teeth.
  Its canines are 7.5 to 10 cm (3.0 to 3.9 in) long and thus the longest among all cats.
