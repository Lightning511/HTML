HTML Code
1. I added a lot of CSS at the beginning of the code to help with the appearance of the website.
2. I added some JavaScript to help people with not perfect vision, by adding an option to enlarge the text size.
3. I worked on adding a lot of bookmarks to my page to improve the navigation of my page, and the citing of sources.
